DEEDS HTR Dataset
=================

A collection of transcriptions for medieval cartularies written in Latin used in the training of HTR models to read medieval texts. 

## Context / Project
- This repository houses a compilation of transcriptions from medieval cartularies written in Latin, specifically curated to serve as training data for HTR models dedicated to deciphering medieval charter texts written in Latin. 
- This dataset was created using eScriptorium, as an interface for HTR ground truth production, and Kraken, an HTR and layout engine. 
- Composed of primarily English cartulary material ranging from the 9th - 16th Centuries 
- More of a focus on material from the 10th - 15th centuries, to develop the machine’s capacity to read more complex scripts (compared to earlier scripts which the machine already performs relatively well on) 
- Dataset is mostly made from pre-existing transcriptions 
  - Supplemented with machine-generated transcriptions that were corrected manually
- This dataset is comprised of transcription data from the following cartularies/manuscripts:
  - British Library, Cotton MS Nero E VI 
  - Bibliothèque Virtuelle des Manuscrits Médiévaux, Cartulaire de l'abbaye du Mont-Saint-Michel, AVRANCHES, Bibliothèque municipale, 0210, 1154-1158
  - Bodleian Library, Founder's and Benefactors' book of Tewkesbury Abbey, Bodleian Library MS. Top. Glouc. d. 2, 16th century 
  - Christ Church Library, Cartulary of Eynsham Abbey, Christ Church MS 341, 1196–1197
  - Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library, Confirmatio chartarum, Charta de foresta, et alia statuta regum Henrici III, Edwardi I, et Edwardi II, fisher2:134, 1316-1422
  - British Library, Cartulary of Reading Abbey, Egerton MS 3031, 1190-1199
  - Archives Departementales de Saone-et-Loire, Cartulary of the bishopric of Autun, G 443, 13th century

## Funding

This project is funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRCC), under the project “Text as Image, Image as Text: Charter integrity and topic modelling”, an Insight Grant under the code 1350911. 

Additional funding is provided by the University of Toronto’s Work-Study program through its Career & Co-Curricular Learning Network.


## Transcription guidelines

The transcription guidelines are described in a paper available on [HAL](https://hal-enc.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03828353): the project follows the guidelines from the CREMMA Medieval datasets.
